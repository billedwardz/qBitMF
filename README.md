# qBitMF (qBittorrent-MultiFace)
qBitMF is a docker container that runs qBittorrent over multiple VPN (or other) interfaces simultaneously. This is an example of a "multiface" torrent client, multiface being a portmanteau of "multiple" and "interface".

qBitMF is a proof of concept, and as such, these things need to be kept in mind:
- This docker container only supports WireGuard interfaces.
- I've only tested this with the Mullvad VPN provider, however it should work with other providers as well.
- PRs for improvements are always welcome, but otherwise this likely won't be maintained much.

On the other hand, the usage of this container should still be simple:
- WireGuard configs added to the `interfaces` directory will be automatically set up and configured.
- qBittorrent cannot leak outside of the VPNs configured, thanks to Linux network namespaces. This includes DNS. (In fact, qBittorrent doesn't even have a way to get the internal docker container IP address, let alone that of the host. It only sees the configured wireguard interfaces and localhost.)

## Getting config files
For qBitMF to work you'll need to provide your own wireguard configuration files. If you have access to your own server feel free to use your own configs.
<br />
If not here are guides for getting configs from various VPN providers.

> **Note**
> To start out, I'd recommend making 2 or 3 config files.

## Configuring Docker (and docker-compose)
Now that we have a collection of config files, we need to configure docker to use those config files.

Grab this git repo, making sure to include the dependency submodules:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/billedwardz/qBitMF.git
```

This repository contains a `docker-compose.yml` file - using it, or basing your docker-compose file on its contents, is recommended.

> **Note**
> With the default configuration, downloads and configuration files generated by qBittorrent will go into the `./downloads` and `./config` directories, respectively. These paths may be changed.

Now, take those WireGuard `.conf` files, and put them all into `./interfaces`.

Once you've done that, run:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will build qBittorrent and start up a docker instance of it running at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

# Configuring qBittorrent

In a browser, visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 with the username `admin` and the password `adminadmin`.

> **Warning**
> Change these credentials. Using the default username and password is bad, especially if you expose this to the internet.

Next, click Options (the gear at the top of the page), and click on Connection.

On this page, we want to set the ports that we collected earlier from Mullvad. Click the checkboxes on the interfaces you have listening ports for, and enter them in.

Scroll down, hit Save, and you're done!

Now you can use qBittorrent as you normally would, but running over multiple interfaces!
